## A New Post
I think a very important point that the author made is making an interface that not only can allow users to be general in their search but also very specific if they need to be. Flexibility in speificity and granularity in a browser or search is the main challenge that search engine and interfaces must solve. For https://maid.moma.org they solved this problem by having different categories (ex. keyword, title, person, etc.). Because the domain of options is reduced only to a set of know images with these types of fields it is easier for this application to meet the vision that Mitchell Whitelaw had about digital interfaces a balance between control, generalization, and immerssion for the end goal of a satisifing query that helps the user gain knowledge and understanding about the problem they are trying to solve.
