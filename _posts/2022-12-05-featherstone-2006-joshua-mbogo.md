## A New Post
Its was interseting to see how the way that digital and traditional archives were talked about. I think what stood out to me the most was the how digital archives have become more like data and more data has been recorded because the type of archive is decentralized. This decentralization is the opposite of the traditional archive which existed as a map or correlation of data that was put together by the librarian / archivist. The reason for a map is because users can't just look up an archive they must have an understanding of how things are connected. This map allows for an understanding of the data but it also makes traditional archives more static than digital which can be mapped in many different ways because it can be filtered and represented in many different ways.
