I think it is important to think about the importance of what you are trying to get out of the data and what you are actually trying to visualize. The article makes a distinction between visualizations that are trying to show data versus a process and how that might change how the data is represented and interpreted. 
This article continues to emphasize context and how it not only grounds a digital humanities project but idetinifies and controls the project to a significant degree.
