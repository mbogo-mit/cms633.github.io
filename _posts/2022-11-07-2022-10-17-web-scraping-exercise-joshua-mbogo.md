##Web Scraping Exercise

It was interesting using the Octoparse webscraper for two main reasons. First because the whole concept of the application was to use it without typing any code a lot of the project felt like learning how to use Octoparse rather than the the implications and usefulness of webscrapping itself. Second thing that was interesting was the type of data that it was able to scrape from Europeana, for example headers and titles on the home page.
