## A New Post
After reading the articles I think it is interesting to look at how Hearst explains the problem of text mining and overall natural langauge processing along with the limitations of the technology of the time. Keeping in mind that the first article read was published in 2003 the models they had could only process text for small phrases and had a very hard time comprehending full though forms in the text. I think this is a great reminder of the complexity of language and the human mind that comprehends and creates language. Additionally, it is interesting to note that unlike many forms of computer analysis that tries to find trends text mining is trying to find new information rather then parse for trends in exisiting data. The creation of new information also known as comprehension and understanding is a very human idea so to see it in computers is a very promising but frightening realization that scientists are continuing to develop. Text mining in this right was the forefront of computer inteligence and has continued to help scientist understand the artificial mind as we use it to understand our own.
