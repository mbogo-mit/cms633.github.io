## A New Post
In the reading Drucker discusses the multiple aspects of visual forms of knowledge and components that go into creating and presenting such information to a person. After reading what stood out to me the most is the importance of an interface that the user can understand. Drucker discusses how interfaces have changed the way we consume and use personal and business information in the modern world. 
Technically even before the advent of graphical user interfaces and tools like a mouse and keyboard to use them, all other mediums to consume information were interfaces but very primitive (newspaper, book, table of contents).
However, in the modern age interface has taken a whole new meaning. Not only does this include what a person sees (shapes, colors, position / organization), this includes sounds (notification bells), and the shape of the interface (ipad, laptops, desktop, phone). Each of these aspects shaping where and how these different interfaces are used and what they are used for in our day to day lives.
With this in mind I explored the plates “The Georgia Negro: A Social Study” created by W.E.B. Du 
Bois and three plates that stood out to me where "Ocuppation of Negores and Whites in Georgia", "Age Distribution of Georgia Negores Compared With France", and "Negro Teachers in Georgia Public Schools".
The first to diagrams use colors and the shape of the graphs to its advantage to show the difference between the two entities being compared to showing a discrepenacy between Negroes and Whites and Negroes and the French population respectively. 
I chose the the third plate because it is an example of how colors and shapes don't always excentuate a specific piece of information but can actually act as a hinderence and take away from the overall message of a dataset.
