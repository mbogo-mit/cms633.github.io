## A New Post
I think a very interesting thing that is discussed is the meaning of interface. Many times people associate the word with a spatial construct but this writing touches how this doesn't have to be the case. It highlights how often we work with interfaces in our daily lives with the example of doorknobs and house surfaces in general. In a broader sense this piece enlightens the reader of how everything in our reality is an interface from our own eyes to our ability to feel and interact with haptic devices. The goal of discussing these types of things is to improve and expand on the types of interfacese we use when building devices and experiences for users. Currently in the modern world we have become very familiar with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and very recently haptic interfaces but as we increasingly peer into the future and the discover the technologies that lye their we also begin to peer into new and exciting interfaces to interact with the modern world.
